						<strong> Abstract: </strong> The Hispanics in Computing community was
            founded a few
            months before the Tapia 2009 Conference. Since then, the group
            has been meeting at this annual conference. The group has grown
            in numbers and online presence (
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/HispanicsInComputing/"
            target="_blank">Facebook
            </a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/6962622"
            target="_blank"> LinkedIn </a>, and
            <a href="#">http://www.hispanicsincomputing.com/</a>). The impact of this
            gathering in our community has been tremendous. Several members
            of the community that attended our BoF as young graduate students
             are now in tenure track positions or employed in research organizations.
             Once again, we propose to hold our annual BoF at the Tapia Conference.
             The gathering will allow many of us to meet face to face and discuss
             issues facing Hispanics. As the undergraduate population attending
             Tapia grows, it is important to serve as mentors for the new students
             starting their careers in computing. The goal for this year’s gathering
             is to explore how to do virtual mentoring to help increase ties within
             the community.
